## First Portfolio

The first iteration of my portfolio site contains a more detailed explanation of each of my prior projects, the development process, and the steps involved. It was made to imitate the design of the Visual Studio Code editor, including a functional tab system for displaying content. This early version of my portfolio is a single-page application (SPA) created using Next.js. I used this project to develop my accessibility skills, including testing with a screen reader.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
